"""Named constants of the adni_sexdiff pipeline.

Two kinds of constant live here.

Conventions
    Paths, environment variables, platform and column names, output file
    names, version pins and the reporting rules of ``AGENTS.md``. They are
    defined below and may be changed by an ordinary change.

Scientific constants
    Statistical choices are scientific decisions. Each enters this module
    only through an OpenSpec proposal that states it before any run, becomes
    a named constant here, and is listed under "Flag and ask" in
    ``AGENTS.md``. None is decided today, so none is defined. The names
    reserved for them (a proposal may rename them) are:

    - ``CLEAN_OPTIONS`` – metabo_adni's QC cutoffs and transforms per
      platform (``--mmc``, ``--mpc``, ``--cv``, ``--icc``, ``--log2``,
      ``--zscore``, ``--winsorize``, ``--remove-moutliers``,
      ``--residualize-meds``).
    - ``COHORT_RULE`` – the baseline visit per participant, the platform
      intersection and any exclusion.
    - ``STAGE_RULE`` – the mapping of ADNI diagnoses onto
      ``STAGE_LABELS`` (CN / MCI / AD), including how subtypes are merged.
    - ``ANALYSIS_COVARIATES`` – the covariate set, order and coding.
    - ``ANALYSIS_PERMUTATIONS``, ``ANALYSIS_SEED``, ``ANALYSIS_ALPHA`` –
      MOTCO's RRPP permutations, seed and rejection rule.
    - ``ANALYSIS_RANK_FLOOR`` – the latent-rank floor passed to MOTCO.
    - ``EXPORT_FEATURE_RULE`` – which cleaned metabolites enter each block
      and on which scale.
    - ``DIAGNOSTIC_VARIABLES``, ``DIAGNOSTIC_CORRELATION_THRESHOLD`` – the
      axis diagnostics' variables and reporting flag.
    - ``READING_RULES`` – the binding reading rules of the report.

# --- Data root -------------------------------------------------------------

#: Environment variable naming the data root; the default is ``data/``.
#: Raw ADNI files are uploaded by hand into it (there is no download step).
DATA_ROOT_ENV = "ADNI_DATA_ROOT"
#: Data root when neither a flag nor ``DATA_ROOT_ENV`` is set.
DEFAULT_DATA_ROOT = "data"

# --- Platforms and columns -------------------------------------------------

#: The metabolomics platforms, as metabo_adni names them (``-P``). Each is
#: one MOTCO block; later ADNI layers are added as blocks by a proposal.
PLATFORMS: tuple[str, ...] = ("p180", "nmr")
#: ADNI's participant key. Any table holding it is participant-level.
PARTICIPANT_ID_COLUMN = "RID"
#: Metadata columns of the MOTCO export (``metadata.csv``), in this order.
SAMPLE_COLUMN = "rid"
GROUP_COLUMN = "sex"
STAGE_COLUMN = "stage"
#: The stages of the design, in trajectory order. The rule that assigns a
#: participant to one of them (``STAGE_RULE``) is undecided.
STAGE_LABELS: tuple[str, ...] = ("CN", "MCI", "AD")

# --- Output directories ----------------------------------------------------

RESULTS_DIR = "results"
CLEANED_DIR = "results/cleaned"
COHORT_DIR = "results/cohort"
MOTCO_INPUT_DIR = "results/motco_input"
MOTCO_ANALYSIS_DIR = "results/motco_analysis"
DIAGNOSTICS_DIR = "results/motco_diagnostics"
REPORTS_DIR = "reports"

# --- Output file names -----------------------------------------------------

#: ``clean``: metabo_adni's cleaned files land in ``<CLEANED_DIR>/<platform>/``
#: with the names metabo_adni gives them; the manifest sits beside them.
CLEAN_MANIFEST = "clean_manifest.json"
#: ``cohort``: the participant table (participant-level) and the aggregate
#: group × stage counts.
COHORT_TABLE = "cohort.csv"
COHORT_COUNTS = "stage_counts.csv"
COHORT_MANIFEST = "cohort_manifest.json"
#: ``export``: one block per platform (``<platform>.csv``), the metadata and
#: covariate tables, a feature table per platform and the manifest.
EXPORT_METADATA = "metadata.csv"
EXPORT_COVARIATES = "covariates.csv"
EXPORT_FEATURES = "features_{platform}.csv"
EXPORT_MANIFEST = "manifest.json"
#: ``analyze``: MOTCO's artifact plus this package's three files.

REPORT_NAME = "motco-adni-{date}.md"

# --- Controlled access -----------------------------------------------------

#: Outputs that are participant-level, as path patterns relative to the
#: repository root. They are never committed, never synced between machines
#: and never quoted. ``.gitignore`` and ``scripts/sync_results.sh`` carry the
#: same list; a change that adds a participant-level output extends all
#: three. Everything not matched here is aggregate.

# --- Software pins and reporting rules ------------------------------------

#: The exact metabo_adni release the lock holds; ``clean`` refuses any other.

#: MOTCO's release tag in ``pyproject.toml``; ``analyze`` refuses an older one.

#: another ``n_jobs`` changes the permutation draws.
